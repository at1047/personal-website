    <p class="text">
        A list of recipes that I always go back to. Stored in a <span class="emph">MongoDB</span> database and queried through <span class="emph">Axios</span> so I don't have to keep looking up the same recipe on the same website everytime I go back to them. Each recipe is my favourite iteration of that food, with tips on preparation that I've accumulated over time.
